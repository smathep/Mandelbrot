# Mandelbrot Renderer

Simple Mandelbrot Set visualizer
Allows the user to customize the zoom scale, centered coordinates, and number of threads used for rendering

To-do list:
- Implement nice command-line driven menue system for allowing user to specify arguments during runtime outside of command line arguments
- (Eventually) implement GUI for controlling render settings
- Allow the user to specify the resolution outside of editing the Driver.java class
